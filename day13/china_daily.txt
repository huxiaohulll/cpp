1.Shenzhen-HK stock link 'likely in second quarter': UBS

The Chinese mainland will likely announce the launch of the much-anticipated 
stock trading link between the Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges in the second 
quarter of the year, further opening the mainland's stock market to overseas 
investors, a senior analyst at UBS Securities said on Wednesday.

If the link is launched this year, it would mean that about 70 percent of market 
capitalization of the A shares will be available to overseas investors who already 
gained access to the mainland market through the existing Shanghai-Hong Kong 
Stock Connect, said Gao Ting, chief China equities strategist at UBS Securities.

The link will broaden investors' stock selection in the mainland as the Shenzhen 
market, unlike Shanghai, is home to many high-tech, innovative companies and 
private firms with high growth potential, Gao said.

"The trading link will increase the investment opportunities for overseas investors 
in sectors including healthcare, consumption, material and information technology," 
he said at a news conference in Beijing.

Premier Li Keqiang said in March that the central government will seek to launch the 
Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect this year.
